# Lego Pixelator
# The Main Thread: Madelyn Jeffers, Zainab Khoshnaw
# Description: This project is an image processor that turns normal images into a pixelated lego-like 
#   veresion. It works by analyzing the original image pixel by pixel and grouping them into color 
#   blocks, making the image look like itâ€™s made out of lego bricks.
